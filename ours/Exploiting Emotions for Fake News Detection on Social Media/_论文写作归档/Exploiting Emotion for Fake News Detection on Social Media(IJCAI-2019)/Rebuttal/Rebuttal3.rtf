Idea is novel and well motivated. But the validation part needs improvement.\

### Rebuttal\
Dear reviewer, we thank for your feedback and your precious time, and response briefly to the comments and concerns here.\
1. The reviewer correctly point out that experiment on Twitter dataset should be involved. That is an omission of our work. But we hope the comprehensive analysis in section 3 could strengthen our assumption.\
2. We agree with the reviewer that Castillo et.al 2011 is old. However, besides this method, we have also compared with two recent and also advanced deep learning works(ML-GRU and HSA LSTM) on fake news detection. ML-GRU is published on IJCAI2016, which learns the hidden representations that capture the variation of contextual information of relevant posts over time. This work has been cited 118 times so far. And HSA-LSTM is published on CIKM2018, which detects fake news and mine the textual information through a hierarchical attention architecture and also incorporate social context information. Both of these two methods are state-of-art works on fake news detection and adequately perform as comparison methods.\
3. We thank the reviewer for the relevant references, which should have been carefully discussed and included in paper but not, because of the page limitations of IJCAI. Paper[1] proposed a TriFN to modeling the tri-relationship between publisher, news pieces and users. While related, our works are substantially different and somehow incomparable to each other. Essentially, paper[1] focus and rely on the relations and interaction in social context, such as  linkages, which is sparse or unreachable on many social medias(such as Weibo). Our method focuses on social content: news content and user comments, which exploiting textual information in the dissemination networks. Paper[2] introduces their annotated datasets and explores the linguistic difference, including NGram, Punctuation, Readability between fake and real news, with a SVM classifier. Paper[3] explore the difference of  stylistic(NGram Readability) features between Left-wing, Right-Wing and fake news in political news. The main point of paper[3] is identifying that left-wing and right-wing article own similar writing style, instead of built tools for detecting fake news. Actually, the authors conclude that style-based fake news classification doesn't work well on their dataset. Overall, paper[2][3] utilize textual features in news content for analysis and classification. Our method aim to explore the emotion and textual information in social content. \
4. We apology for being unclear about confusing explanation of new clustering, which will be addressed in the final version. If there are similar topics between training set and testing test, model's performance could result from fitting in topic bias between fake and real news dataset, instead of characteristics of fake news. }
