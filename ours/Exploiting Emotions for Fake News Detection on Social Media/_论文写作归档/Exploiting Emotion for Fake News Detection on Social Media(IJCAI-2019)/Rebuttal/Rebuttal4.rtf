Interesting, well written and motivated. Methedology is clear. There are some questions, which however, do not undermine the interest of the work.\

### Rebuttal\

Dear Reviewer, we really thank you for your positive and constructive feedbacks. And we would like to address the concerns below:\
1. The reviewer suggest that explanation about data collection is unclear. We agree with that and will make it clear in the next version. The fake news pieces are collected from official debunking committee of Weibo, which consists of reputable users who examine the cases and verify them as false or real. We collected all tweet that is verfied false and drop duplications. This system actually serves as an authoritative source to collect rumor tweets in many literatures. We collected similar amount of real news from Newsverify, a real-time certification system on Weibo where all news pieces are veried truth by experts. This link is attched in paper.\
2. The tagged emotion corpus is used for gaining emotion embedding of words. And this corpus is a external dataset which is not associated with the training data at all. We could promise that the emotion corpus doesn't introduce bias in training data.\
3. In this paper, we take the output probability of last softmax layer in emotion classification model as the emotional intensity level. For example, if the output distribution of a sentence is \{anger:0.4, happiness:0.1, none:0.1, doubt:0.2, sadniess:0.2\}, then the emotion category of this sentence is anger and its corresponding intensity level is 0.4.}
