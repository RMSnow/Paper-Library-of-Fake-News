Claims are not true, and the assumption limits the scope.\

### Retuttal\
\
Dear reviewer, we thank for your time and valuable comments. And we would respond to the comments and criticisms as follows:\
1. We apology for unclear and confusing explanation of dataset and will revise this part in final version. In this paper, a microblog's content along with its responses as a whole is categorized as a piece of news. And fake news are collected from official debunking committee of Weibo, which consists of reputable users who examine the cases and verify them as false or real. This system actually serves as an authoritative source to collect rumor tweets in many literatures.\
2. We didn't make claim that emotion was not utilized in previous work. Instead, we admitted in abstract and introduction that previous work mainly mine emotion signals through statistical features and user viewpoints. Actually, we did claim that there is still room for exploiting emotion, and introducing two-side emotions: publisher emotion and social emotion would be an effective way to do this.\
3. We agree with the reviewer that emotion could not categorize all fake news. However, none of clickbait, writing style or readability could. But they have things in common and correlated. Incentive writing may also contain specific emotions, or aim to evoke specific emotions in responses. And our work aims to explore these incentives by focusing on emotion aspect.\
4. We apology for the short explanation about the motivation of using emotion embedding due to the paper page limits of IJCAI, and would include more representative emotion works in Related Work in the final version. In this paper, we would like to obtain enriched emotion representation of words or sentence, not just sentiment value or metrics of a sentence(such as Vader Sentiment). Emotion embedding could help us obtain a latent emotion representation vector for each word through supervised model, which is more informative and task-specific(by using Weibo sentiment corpus). In addition, we have incorporated other sentiment features extracted by previous emotion tools in our model(see Hand-crafted News Emotion Features in Section 4.1). We also conduct experiments on comparing emotion embedding with using sentiment dictionary in Table 3(WSE and WEE).\
5. You mention that Castillo 2011 is too old and not specifically built for fake news detection, more recent methods should be involved. In fact, the other two models we compared with(ML-GRU and HSA-LSTM) are released in 2016 and 2018 respectively, and focusing on fake news(rumor) detection with deep learning framework. Both of two models are advanced and strong enough to perform as convincing comparison methods.(Details could be seen in rebuttal reply of Review #251430)\
6. We demonstrate the differences of emotion in content and responses between fake news and real news by three folds:category, intensity and expression. Overall, analysis results are consistent with expectation that emotion in fake news(content and responses) is more intense and involve more negative emotion(doubt, anger). In Figure2b, ratio of doubt and anger in fake news comments is nearly 7% higher than real news which, however contains about 7% more happy emotion. Similar trend exists in emotion intensity and expression. We think they as a whole could support the assumption.}
