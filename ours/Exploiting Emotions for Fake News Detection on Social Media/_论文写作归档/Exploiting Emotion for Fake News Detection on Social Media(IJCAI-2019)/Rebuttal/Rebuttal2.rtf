Well written and motivated. But motivation owes concerns.\

### Rebuttal\
Dear Reviewer, we thank for your constructive suggestions, and now provide our specific responses and clarifications are as below:\
1. Here, we agree with the reviewer that many fake news articles don't own emotion signals, such as "There is people living on the Mars." However, compared to real news, this kind of articles could be more possibly to evoke intense emotion in the crowd, as is shown in Figure 1b. That's the reason and motivation that we introduce two-side emotions: publisher emotion and social emotion in this paper. The former capture the emotion of news content posted by the publisher. And the later is designed to address the mentioned circumstance that news contents are unemotional but aim to raise intense emotion in public for gaining dissemination. In addition, our analysis results in Section 3 prove the differences between fake news and real news, in both news content and comments from different perspectives.\
2. We thank the reviewer for mentioning reference[1], which is related and should be included. However, we respectfully point out that this paper uses information from both text and image, which is very different from our work and somehow incomparable. Actually, besides traditional feature-based methods, we have also compared with two recent and also advanced deep learning works(ML-GRU and HSA LSTM) on fake news detection. ML-GRU is published on IJCAI2016, which learns the hidden representations that capture the variation of contextual information of relevant posts over time. This work has been cited 118 times so far. And HSA-LSTM is published on CIKM2018, which detects fake news and mine the textual information through a hierarchical attention architecture and also utilizing social context information. We believe both of these two methods are state-of-art works on fake news detection and adequate enough to perform as comparison methods to prove the effectiveness of our model.}
